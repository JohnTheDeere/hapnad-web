            <p>Hapnad <i>/hɛːpnad/</i>, inspired from Swedish <i>"häpnad"</i> meaning surprise or astonishment, reflects the core impression we want our customers to have after working with us. In a world driven by deteriorating quality to maximize profit, we aim to offer a counterbalance by prioritizing beauty over the bottom line.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <p>The concept for this company was born while organizing our wedding, and us wanting to create a lasting impression for our guests. We realized surprise is essential. While the usual eventually slips from memory, it's the unforeseen we rarely forget.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <p>We knew our guests would not expect beautiful laser engraved place cards of wood with pictures of themselves, so that's what we did. The response exceeded our wildest hopes, which led us to starting this venture.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Today, we create that same unexpected delight for our customers through photorealistic laser engravings suitable any imaginable occasion.</p>
