            <p>Hapnad, from the Swedish word for astonishment, 'häpnad' (/hɛːpnad/), reflects the experience we want to deliver to our clients. In a world driven by deteriorating quality to maximize profit, we aim to offer a counterbalance by prioritizing beauty over the bottom line.</p>

            <p>The concept for this company was born while organizing our wedding, and us wanting to create a lasting impression for our guests. We realized surprise is essential. While the usual eventually slips from memory, it's the unforeseen we rarely forget.</p>

            <p>We knew our guests would not expect beautiful wooden place cards with engraved pictures of themselves, so that's what we did. The response exceeded our wildest hopes, which led us to starting this venture.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <p>Today, we create that same unexpected delight for our customers through photorealistic laser engravings suitable for any imaginable occasion.</p>
